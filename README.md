# mapmaker
A mod I'm working on to allow for easy map art creation. Right now it is targetting fabric, but I hope to expand support to Neoforge as well eventually.

## Dependencies

## Current Features
- None as of the moment

## Roadmap

- Import images and convert them to valid map dimensions and colors
- Generate map files from images
- Configurable gamerules and permissions for creating map files
- Schematic system for building the maps without cheating in a map item
- UI to manage schematics / maps
- Support for converting schematics to litematica schematics
- Neoforge support
